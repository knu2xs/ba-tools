# ArcGIS Business Analyst Python Tools 0.9.1.dev0 Documentation

This is the documentation for ArcGIS Business Analyst Python Tools. All the Markdown (`md`) files in
`./docsrc/mkdocs` become the documentation pages.

## Notebooks

Any Jupyter Noteoboks located in `./docsrc/mkdocs/notebooks` will be converted into documentation pages able to be
included in your table of contents specified in `./docsrc/mkdocs.yml`. You will need to manually move any Jupyter
Notebooks you want included in the documentation into this directory.

!!! note

    I used to automatically copy Jupyter Notebooks from `./notebooks` into the documentation, but this created two problems.
    First, a LOT of the notebooks were copied, which were not needed in the documentation. Second, frequently I did something
    to alter the Notebook I did not really want in the documentation. 
    
    Hence, to avoid these two issues, now the template requires deliberately moving the Jupyter Notebooks you want to include 
    in the documentation from `./notebooks` to `./docsrc/mkdocs/notebooks`.

## MkDocs

Documentation is built using MkDocs with a few extensions.

- [MkDocs: Writing Your Docs](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/) - this is a great place to start
  understanding how to write and structure your documentation
- [MkDocStrings: Usage](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/usage/#autodoc-syntax) - Extension creating docstrings directly
  from docstrings in the Python package built with your project. This is configured to use Google docstring conventions.
- [MkDocs-Jupyter](https://mkdocs-jupyter.danielfrg.com/) - Extension enabling inclusion of Notebooks directly in the
  documentation.
- [MkDocs-Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) - Theme used for the documentation. Useful
  information for customizing the theme if you want.
- [Admonitions](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/) - How to add Notes, etc.


## Commands

Here are a few commonly used commands for efficient project configuration and use.

* `make env` - creates a Conda environment in the project directory in `./env` with resources needed for project development
* `make jupyter` - run Jupyter notebook with options enabling connecting from another computer on the same network if desired
* `make data` - build data using the file `./scripts/make_data.py` using the Conda environment `./env` created with the command    
  `make env`
* `make docs` - builds documentation in `./docs` from resources in `./docsrc`.
* `make docserve` - runs live server on http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to see updates to docs in real
  time. This is extremely useful when building the documentation to see how it will look.

!!! note

    These commands are defined in `./make.cmd` if you want to examine, modify or extend this capability.

## Documentation layout

Files in the `./docsrc` directory are used to build the documentation. The following files are included by
default.

    mkdocs.yml                    # MkDocs configuration file. This is where navigation is set up.
    mkdocs/
        index.md                  # Documentation homepage.
        api.md                    # API (Python package) documentation generated from docstrings using MkDocStrings
        notebooks/                # Directory to put Jupyter Notebooks
        ...                       # Other markdown pages, images and files.

!!! note
    
    The structure of the documentation pages is derived directly from the way files are organized in this directory. This is well explained in the [MkDocs: File Layout](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/#file-layout) documentation.
